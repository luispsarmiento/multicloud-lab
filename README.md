# ☁️ Multicloud Lab

A repository of practices and examples for cloud services across the market-leading platforms: AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## 📋 Overview

This repository serves as a personal multi-cloud learning laboratory where I explore, document, and compare services from the three major public cloud platforms. Each example is designed to understand the capabilities, differences, and best practices of each provider.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Experiment with equivalent services across different cloud providers
- Compare implementations and approaches between platforms
- Document multi-cloud patterns and best practices
- Create reusable examples in various programming languages
